# Reinforcement Learning Environments: Taxi and Frozen Lake
This project focuses on implementing reinforcement learning problems using two environments: "Taxi-v3" and "FrozenLake-v1" from the new update version `gymnasium library`. These environments provide different scenarios to train agents using reinforcement learning techniques.


## Taxi-v3 Environment
The "Taxi-v3" environment simulates a grid world where a taxi operates. The objective is to pick up passengers from specific locations and drop them off at their desired destinations. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions.
## FrozenLake-v1 Environment
The "FrozenLake-v1" environment is a part of the Toy Text environments in the Gym library. In this environment, the agent navigates a frozen lake from the starting point to the goal without falling into any holes. The agent receives rewards or penalties for each move it makes.


## Requirement
In the following code snippet, you can find the minimum libraries needed to perform this exercise. You can
create a python virtual environment using conda by saving the following snippet into `requirements.yml` and
running `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
Additionaly, it will ask to pip install `pygame` dependencies to render a gym env.
