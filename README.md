In this we have implement two methods –Gradient Descent method and Newton’s method for function minimalization(please, be aware that the user should have a possibility to select which method will be takenfor function minimalization).
 With case of stopping conditions
 {
•Maximum number of iterations
•Desiredvalue 𝐹(𝑥)or 𝐺(𝑥)to  reach(so  the  processis  finished  when 𝐹(𝑥)≥𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ/ 𝐺(𝑥)≥𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒_𝑡𝑜_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ)
•Maximum computation time
 }

 In this we have implementation must have the following componentsand fulfil the following requirements:
 •Roulette-wheel selection with scaling
 •Single point crossover
 •FIFO replacement strategy
 •Genetic algorithm must use binary vectors
  The user should also have a possibility to specify diversified parameters of the algorithm. They are as follows:
  •The problem dimensionality
  •The range of searched integers as 𝑑≥1that for each dimension i, −2^d≤𝑥(i)<2^d
  •Function parameters A, b, c
  •The algorithm parameters as: population size, crossover probability, mutation probability, number of algorithms iterations

  Program that plays tic-tac-toe with the user on a 3×3board. The game continues until one of the players wins or it is a draw. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally)wins.
  Algorithm: min-max with alpha-beta pruning.
